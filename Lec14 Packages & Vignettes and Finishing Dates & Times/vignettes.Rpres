Hadley Wickham
========================================================

Introducing Hadley Wickham, author of the **Hadleyverse** of packages
(`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `devtools`) and countless other tools.

* A
[priceonomics](http://priceonomics.com/hadley-wickham-the-man-who-revolutionized-r/)
article on him.
* He's also got a large Twitter following. Among my favorite
[tweets](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/589068687669243905?lang=en) of
his.



R Packages
========================================================

One thing we won't be covering in this class is **creating R packages**: if you have

* Data
* Code
* Analyses

that you want to share with the world, creating your own R package is the way to go.



R Packages
========================================================

If you do want to learn how to write your own R packages, visit
[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). You have all the tools to
follow along.

Two example packages of mine:

* [`resampledata`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/resampledata): contains all
the datasets from my MATH 311 Theory of Statistics class
* [`SpatialEpi`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/SpatialEpi2): Methods and Data
for Spatial Epidemiology.



Vignette
========================================================

Any good package is going to have a vignette. As Hadley Wickham describes them:

> A vignette is a long-form guide to your package. 
> * Function documentation is great if you know the name of the function you
need, but itâ€™s useless otherwise.
> * A vignette is like a book chapter or an academic paper: it can describe the
problem that your package is designed to solve, and then show the reader how to
solve it.



Examples
========================================================

* Type `browseVignettes()` in the console
* Search for `dplyr`
* Click on HTML for "Introduction to dplyr""



Analogy
========================================================

* **Help files are like instruction manuals**: you don't read the whole thing; you
read what you need, when you need it.
* **Vignettes are like [get started
guides](http://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/apple-ipad-air-unboxing-3.jpg)**:
helps you get started and gives the executive summary.
